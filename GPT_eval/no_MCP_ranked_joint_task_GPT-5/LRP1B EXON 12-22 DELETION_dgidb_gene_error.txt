### MESSAGES ###
[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a chatbot for the CIViC and Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). You receive a gene and DGIdb interaction for that gene. Your task is to return a ranked list of up to 20 drugs.\n\nRANKING RULES:\n1. List FDA-approved drugs first.\n2. Within the approved drugs, sort by the DGIdb interactionScore in descending order (higher interactionScore = higher priority).\n3. After all approved drugs, list non-approved drugs, also sorted by interactionScore in descending order.\n4. Return only drug names (no scores), as a comma-separated list like: DRUG1,DRUG2.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What drugs target or modulate this gene product in DGIdb? Gene: I CAN FETCH THE EXACT CIVIC ENTRIES AND RANK THE GENES BY EVIDENCE STRENGTH \nReturn a comma-separated list of up to 20 drug names following the ranking rules.'}]

### LLM OUTPUT ###
Please provide a valid HGNC gene symbol and the DGIdb interactions (including FDA approval status and interactionScores). The provided text isn’t a gene.
