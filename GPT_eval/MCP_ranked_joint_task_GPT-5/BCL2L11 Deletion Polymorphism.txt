      "description": "The BIM (BCL2L11) deletion polymorphism was identified in an EGFR Mutant NSCLC cell line with resistance to EGFR-TKI (HCC2779). Introduction of this polymorphism in a previously EGFR-inhibitor sensitive cell line led to TKI-resistance. In 141 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, the presence of the polymorphism (N=26) was predictive of a significantly shorter PFS under treatment with EGFR-TKI (6.6 months vs. 11.9 months, p = 0.0027). Patients received either gefitinib only (N=136) or erlotinib only (N=5).",
