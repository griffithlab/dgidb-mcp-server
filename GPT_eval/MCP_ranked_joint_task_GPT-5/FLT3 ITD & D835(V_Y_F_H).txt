Mutations at 3 AL residues (D835 [n = 31], D839 [n = 3], and Y842 [n = 16]), with varying degrees of resistance to ponatinib were identified. FLT3 D835 mutations were shown to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 and ponatinib. \
This was especially found for D835Y and D835V mutations, whereas D835H mutations were found to confer moderate resistance to ponatinib but relatively minimal resistance to AC220.",
