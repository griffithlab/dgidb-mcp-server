      "description": "ESR1 S463P variants were observed after extensive treatment with hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibition). Expression of the S463P mutant was found to induce modest activity in the absence of hormone. This mutation displayed elevated levels of Ser118 phosphorylation compared to wild-type ERα and appeared to possess estrogen-independent activity.",
