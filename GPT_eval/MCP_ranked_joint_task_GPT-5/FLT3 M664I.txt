      "description": "Overall response rate was 21% in this clinical trial with Pexidartinib on relapsed or refractory AML patients with FLT3-ITD. Forty two out of the total 90 patients were tested for FLT3 KD mutations before treatment. Four patients were F691L positive, and three of them had no response to Pexidartinib, one of them achieved a incomplete hematologic recovery, the F691L was detected in 2.58% of non-ITD containing FLT3 alleles. This patient acquired new D835Y mutation and the F691L was not detectable at the time of Pexidartinib relapse. Of note, all 4 patients were treated below the recommended phase 2 dosage of 3000 mg per day. The response rate and any other FLT3 KD mutations were not particularly described for those 38 F691L negative patients.",

The N841K mutation was subsequently tested on a FLT3-ITD only background and FLT3-ITD+F691L background. The presence of N841K in either background when exposed to PLX3397 showed a higher IC50 in a Ba/F3 proliferation assay (6.4uM on FLT3-ITD background and >10uM on FLT3-ITD+F691L background) compared to FLT3-ITD alone (0.15uM) or FLT3-ITD+F691L (0.38um) [values in Supplemental Table4 visualized in Figure 3C]. N841K on the FLT3-ITD background also showed resistance to PLX3397 based on biochemical assays [western blots of pFLT3, FLT3, pSTAT5, STAT5 - showed no appreciable decrease in levels with increase dose as compared to FLT3-ITD alone - data not quantitate Figure 3D].",
