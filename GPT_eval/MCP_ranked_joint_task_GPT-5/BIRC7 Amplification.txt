      "description": "Livin (BIRC7) overexpression in two colon cancer cell lines (RKO and SW620) increased resistance of these cells to cisplatin. siRNA knockdown of Livin rendered the cells more sensitive to cisplatin. The study also further showed that cytoplasmic Livin levels increased in four colon cancer cell lines (RKO, SW620, HCT116, and KM12C) after cisplatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. This study highlighted Livin as a potential player in colon cancer therapy.",
