After 5 years of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the disease relapsed. EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and the patient was subsequently treated with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody panitumumab. However, there was a rapid clinical worsening, which may possibly be attributed to a somatic mutation in KRAS (Q22*).",
