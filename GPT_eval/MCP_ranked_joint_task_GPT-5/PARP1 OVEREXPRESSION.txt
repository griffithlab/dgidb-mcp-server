      "description": "Researchers compared biomarkers in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) enriched and mature cancer cell populations from human breast cancer cell lines.  Overexpression of PARP1 was found in BCSC enriched populations (detected by ALDH+) when compared to mature cell populations (ALDH-) in 4 BRCA1 mutant and 1 BRCA1 wild-type cell lines.  Cell lines were treated with 10 µm olaparib.  The cell line with the highest PARP1 expression (HCC1937) showed a significant increase cell population after treatment (p=0.01).  PARP1 overexpression was found to be positively correlated with olaparib resistance (R²=0.9374).",
