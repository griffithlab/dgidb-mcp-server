      "description": "In-vitro study with MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Sirt1 by increasing concentrations of nicotinamide led to a decrease in viability. Gefitinib treatment with concentrations of 50 μM showed similar effects as observed for the application of 25 mM nicotinamide. Combinatory treatment with gefitinib and nicotinamide showed a synergistic effect on cell viability. In cell lines overexpressing Sirt1, higher concentrations of nicotinamide were required to abrogate increased cell viability mediated by Sirt1 overexpression compared to controls.",
