      "description": "This preclinical study tested the efficacy on several breast cancer cell lines of GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a selective inhibitor of all four isoforms of class I PI3-kinases over a range of IC50 values. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-231 is a basal-type breast cancer cell line which harbors KRAS G13D, and it had an ICD50 of 20uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice and allowed to grow. Mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and treated with pictilisib saw no reduction in tumor volume compared to untreated control. There was no effect on G1 arrest in pictilisib treated cells; however, phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced following pictilisib. Authors note that basal breast cancer cell lines were generally more resistant to pictilisib than luminal lines (p=0.02), and concluded that this cell line was resistant to pictilisib.",
