      "description": "A preclinical study tested the effects of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on Ba/F3 cell lines with representative primary regorafenib-sensitizing mutation del 557-558, which induced IL-3 independent growth, and secondary mutation T670I. The cells were tested for Regorafenib resistance. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558/T670I mutations (IC50 = 132 +- 25 nM) did show resistance towards  Regorafenib  compared to Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 alone (IC50 = 30 +- 14 nM). In addition, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Regorafenib. In Regorafenib incubated cells, T670I mutations were seen in approximately 10% of the resistant cell populations. The results suggest that T670I does induce regorafenib resistance in del 557-558/T670I cells.",
