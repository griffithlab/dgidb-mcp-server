      "description": "High expression of TIMP-1 was assessed by IHC in 99 primary breast cancers that had not spread beyond the breast after 6 postoperative courses of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. High TIMP1 levels were associated with worse 5-year disease free survival (71.1%) than low levels (88.5 %; P = 0.020). High TIMP-1 levels were also associated with worse 5-year overall survival (78.9 %) than low levels (96.7 %; P = 0.004).",

Genome wide amplification was assessed by Affymetrix SNP arrays and expression was assessed by Affymetrix gene expression arrays. ABCC3 amplification (and expression) in ERBB2 (HER2) amplified breast cancer cell lines was associated with resistance to paclitaxel and  MMAE. Three independently derived EVSA-T cell lines overexpressing ABCC3 were at least 20-fold less sensitive to paclitaxel and MMAE based on EC50 values.",
