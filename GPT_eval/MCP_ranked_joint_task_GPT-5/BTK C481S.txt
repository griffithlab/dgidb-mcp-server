Sequencing of sequential samples of this patient revealed a novel BTK T316 mutation at relapse (allele frequency of 75%). Characterization of this mutation showed that is was located on the SH2 domain, not associated with Ibrutinib binding. Introduction of this mutation in an Ibrutinib-sensitive lymphoma cell line showed resistance comparable to the known C481 resistance mutations, which was also confirmed by absence of downstream signaling.",
