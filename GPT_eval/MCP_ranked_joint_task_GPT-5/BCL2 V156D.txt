\
\
\
\
Targeted sequencing found G101V in refractory CLL tissues in 3 out of 4 of the patients, but not in sequencing performed before venetoclax treatment. \
\
Indepth sequencing performed on one of the patients showed the variant allele fraction of G101V increasing from 9% to 16% during disease progression.\
\
Sequencing of 546 venetoclax-naive CLL patients was reported, and none had BCL2 G101V. The variant was also not observed in four patients who relapsed after time-limited venetoclax therapy. The authors suggest that time-restricted venetoclax treatment in combination with a second drug may lower risk of developing resistance variants.",

Based on Tausch et al work (PMID 31004028), this group re-investigated the presence of BCL2 G101V mutation in their cohort using the method reported by Blombery et al (PMID 30517404). BCL2 G101V mutation was identified at very low allele frequency (from <1% to 1.4%) in three out of these 9 patients. In one of the patients, BCL2 G101V mutation is only present in two sites (BM and LN) but not in peripheral blood. This study argues against the hypothesis that the resistance to venetoclax can be explained by the BCL2 G101V mutation alone. Instead, this study propose that the BCL2 G101V mutation is a rather late, subclonal event that may mediate some resistance against CLL cells, but the mechanism of resistance to venetoclax remains far from being understood.",

Patient cells from a later timepoint displayed the BCL2 G101V mutation in addition to D103Y. Of note the BCL2 G101V variant was not detectable at 39 months and only present at the latest time point with a VAF of 14%.

Resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect in the P2 pocket of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152 as affinity for venetoclax was restored in BCL2 G101V through the introduction of an E152A mutation (Ki =.002nM). Additionally, BCL2 G101V maintains similar affinity for apoptotic BH3 peptides, which assists in the prevention of apoptosis.",
