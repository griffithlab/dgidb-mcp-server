      "description": "Case report of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring both a mutation in EGFR and an amplification of MET. After progression on erlotinib the patient was treated with combined type I MET (savolitinib) and EGFR (osimertinib) inhibition and responded. When resistance developed, a new MET kinase domain mutation, D1228V, was detected. Drug binding predictions and in vitro studies demonstrated that the D1228V mutation induces resistance to type I but not type II MET TKIs. The patient was treated with erlotinib (EGFR TKI) combined with cabozantinib, a type II MET inhibitor, and had a response which continued at the time of report (5 months).",
