      "description": "The effect of high CCNE1 expression on PD0332991 (palbociclib) sensitivity was observed in cell lines.  One PD0332991 sensitive cell line, HEY, was engineered to constitutively express CCNE1 (HEY-CCNE1).  HEY-CCNE1 was shown to have significantly increased resistance to PD0332991.  CCNE1-amplified OVCAR3 cells were also resistant to PD0332991.  50-70% reduction of CCNE1 via lentiviral shRNAs sensitized OVCAR3 cells to PD0332991.  These combined results suggest high CCNE1 expression is required for resistance to PD0332991.",
