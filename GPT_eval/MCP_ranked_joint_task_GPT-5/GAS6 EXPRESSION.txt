      "description": "Prostate Cancer (PCa) cell lines were either cultured alone, co-cultured with osteoblasts expressing GAS6, or cultured in the presence of media with GAS6 to examine their response to therapy with docetaxel. Docetaxel efficiently induced apoptosis in the cells cultured without any GAS6, but it was not able to do so in the cells that were in media with GAS6 present or that were co-cultured with osteoblasts expressing GAS6. PCa cells in the presence of GAS6 were found to be in G1 phase for a greater duration which may help explain the increased resistance to docetaxel.",
