      "description": "102 mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy were analyzed for 34 hotspot mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF with nanofluidic digital PCR and quantitative PCR. dPCR and qPCR results were correlated to PFS and OS. Analysis of only KRAS exon 2 hotspot mutations showed that patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 19/83) had a hazard ratio of 3.43 for PFS (95% CI, 1.67–7.02; P=0.002) and 2.72 for OS (95% CI, 1.52–4.88; P=0.002) compared to wild-type patients or patients with less than 1% mutant allele fraction. Considering all RAS and BRAF mutations, the patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 37/65) had a hazard ratio of 4.52 for PFS (95% CI, 2.25–9.07; P<0.001) and 2.5 for OS (95% CI, 1.57–4.02; P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that a cut-off of 1% for any mutated allele offered the best predictive value.",
