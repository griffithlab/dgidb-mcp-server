      "description": "In this preclinical study, cell lines with constitutively-active G12V mutant found that forced overexpression of HRAS G12V caused a reduced susceptibility to PI3K inhibitor BYL719 in comparison to wild type KRAS cell lines (p < 0.05 for Cal33:HRAS G12V) and increased the rate of cellular proliferation. Inhibiting HRAS through siRNA knockout caused a substantial decrease in transcript levels ( >80%) and increased sensitivity to BYL719 in the HRAS G12V cell line (T24).",
