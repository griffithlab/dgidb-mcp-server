      "description": "In an in vitro study, a MCAS cell line expressing KRAS G12D mutation was associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab treatment as compared to RMUG-L and OMC-1 cells expressing wild-type KRAS. Resistance was determined by assessing cell growth. Further, in an in vivo experiment, KRAS G12D expressing MCAS xenografts in nude mice had reduced response to cetuximab, as compared to KRAS wild-type expressing RMUG-L xenografts. Resistance was determined by assessing tumor growth.",
