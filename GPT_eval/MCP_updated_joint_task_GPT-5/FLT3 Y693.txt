Similar resistance was found in cells bearing FLT3-ITD F691L or FLT3-ITD D698N as well. It was also revealed by molecular modeling that the lack of aromatic rings in FLT3 Y693C/N may contribute to the reduced affinity of Gilteritinib to Y693 mutations. BTW, the main content of this research article supports that Gilteritinib is active against many clinically relevant activating FLT3 mutations.",

Similar resistance was found in cells bearing FLT3-ITD Y693C/N or FLT3-ITD D698N as well. It was also revealed by molecular modeling that the smaller side chain or the lack of aromatic rings in the mutants may contribute to the reduced affinity of Gilteritinib to the mutated forms of FLT3.

Similar resistance was found in cells bearing FLT3-ITD F691L or FLT3-ITD D698N as well. Molecular modeling reveals that G697S variant caused loss of interaction and a steric clash with the phenyl ring of Gilteritinib, which may explain the reduced of inhibitory activity. The authors also noted G697S has never been identified clinically.",
