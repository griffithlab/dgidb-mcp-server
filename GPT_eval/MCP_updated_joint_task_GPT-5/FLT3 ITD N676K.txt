      "description": "In a study looking for mechanisms of resistance within a phase 2 study using PKC412 (midostaurin), a 60 year old male with normal karyotype AML was identified with FLT3-ITD-N676K mutation. This mutation was shown to be within the FLT3-ITD. He was initially enrolled after failing induction and reinduction therapy and shown to harbor a FLT3-ITD. By day 204 on trial he had complete elimination of blasts; however, by day 280 he had a bone marrow biopsy with >90% blasts. Dose escalation provided no clinical benefit. Serum at Day 288 showed adequate levels of active metabolite. Subsequent in vitro assays demonstrated 10-fold higher resistance to PKC412 in 32D cells expressing FLT3-ITD-N676K versus FLT3-ITD.",

Constructs containing the G697R mutant conferred high level resistance to several FLT3 inhibitors (including PKC412, SU5614, or K-252a). The G697R mutation may be a clinically problematic resistance mutation that warrants further testing.",

      "description": "A screen using saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected TF1 cells in the FLT3 TKI midostaurin identified F691L in 1 of 400 clones. Cytotoxicity assessed by MTT demonstrated Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3/ITD F691L conferred moderate resistance to midostaurin (IC50: 18nM) compared to FLT3/ITD control cells (IC50: 4nM). Immunoblotting showed midostaurin was able to partially inhibit FLT3 autophosphorylation and the activation of downstream pathways in Ba/F3 FLT3/ITD F691L cells. Structural modeling revealed F691 to be located in the ATP binding cleft. The authors hypothesize this amino acid change weakens inhibitor affinity as this residue likely makes direct contact with FLT3 TKIs.",
