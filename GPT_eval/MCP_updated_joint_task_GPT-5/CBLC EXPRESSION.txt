Overexpression of PARP1 was found in BCSC enriched populations (detected by ALDH+) when compared to mature cell populations (ALDH-) in 4 BRCA1 mutant and 1 BRCA1 wild-type cell lines.  Cell lines were treated with 10 µm olaparib.  The cell line with the highest PARP1 expression (HCC1937) showed a significant increase cell population after treatment (p=0.01).  PARP1 overexpression was found to be positively correlated with olaparib resistance (R²=0.9374).",
