Of 18 patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 experienced clinical benefit: 2 partial responses and 8 patients experiencing stable disease for longer than 8 weeks. The median days on treatment was 58.5 (13-394) with one patient ongoing treatment at the end of the study period (56 weeks). The response rate of patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC was 11%, and 71% showed decrease in metabolic response (less FDG uptake in FDG-PET analysis). All responders showed decreases in FDG-uptake. There was not a significant decrease in Ki67 expression between day 1 and day 15 of treatment. Authors conclude that RO4987655 has some clinical activity in KRAS mutated NSCLC, though patients with KRAS wild-type NSCLC were excluded from this expansion study, so it is not possible to determine whether activity of RO4987655 in NSCLC is related to KRAS mutation status.",

Univariate analysis identified gender, smoking history, histology and GNAS1 T393C polymorphism as predictive marker of PFS (P=0.04, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.005). Multivariate analysis of factors, including smoking history, performance status score, histology, GNAS1 T393C polymorphism demonstrated that GNAS1 T393C polymorphism was correlated independently with PFS (P=0.007). The data suggests the role of GNAS1 T393C CC genotype as a poor predictive marker both of DCR and PFS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor.",

The observation group received gemcitabine concomitant with nedaplatin while the control group was treated with cisplatin concomitant with gemcitabine.The positive expression rates of ERCC1, RRM1 and LRP were 47.1% (16/34), 61.8% (21/34) and 64.7% (22/34) in the observation group, respectively. Patients with positive ERCC1 expression had a decreasing trend of objective response rate and overall survival time compared to the patients with negative ERCC1 expression.The positive expression of RRM1 and LRP further noticeably  increased the patients resistance to gemcitabine and nedaplatin.. The results showed the short and long term effects were the same for both groups, but gemcitabine concomitant with nedaplatin is ideal for weaker patients as the side effects are not as taxing on the body.",

One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient\'s best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot. The authors note that ALK G1269A likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain.",

Two ALK+ patients had ALK L1196M co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. Mutation presence pre-treatment could not be evaluated. Both patients were non-smokers, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 4th line therapy. Both experienced partial response. One was a 52 year old male with large cell carcinoma treated for 124 days. The other was a 49 year old female with adenocarcinoma treated for 825 days. In vitro, a Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (a known sensitizing alteration to crizotinib) and an ALK L1196M co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (766 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion alone. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. The authors note that ALK L1196M likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain.",

The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).",

G2032R is thought to result in steric hindrance with crizotinib,16 while D2033N leads to a reorientation of neighboring residues in front of the ATP binding pocket interacting with crizotinib and loss of a key electrostatic interaction between D2033 and crizotinib.
