\
\
\
\
Targeted sequencing found G101V in refractory CLL tissues in 3 out of 4 of the patients, but not in sequencing performed before venetoclax treatment. \
\
Indepth sequencing performed on one of the patients showed the variant allele fraction of G101V increasing from 9% to 16% during disease progression.\
\
Sequencing of 546 venetoclax-naive CLL patients was reported, and none had BCL2 G101V. The variant was also not observed in four patients who relapsed after time-limited venetoclax therapy. The authors suggest that time-restricted venetoclax treatment in combination with a second drug may lower risk of developing resistance variants.",

      "description": "Previous work by this group used WES and was unable to identify BCL2 G101V mutation in 9 CLL patients with resistance to venetoclax (PMID 29463802). Based on Tausch et al work (PMID 31004028), this group re-investigated the presence of BCL2 G101V mutation in their cohort using the method reported by Blombery et al (PMID 30517404). BCL2 G101V mutation was identified at very low allele frequency (from <1% to 1.4%) in three out of these 9 patients. In one of the patients, BCL2 G101V mutation is only present in two sites (BM and LN) but not in peripheral blood. This study argues against the hypothesis that the resistance to venetoclax can be explained by the BCL2 G101V mutation alone. Instead, this study propose that the BCL2 G101V mutation is a rather late, subclonal event that may mediate some resistance against CLL cells, but the mechanism of resistance to venetoclax remains far from being understood.",

Overexpressing DLBCL BCL2 cell lines (SU-DHL-4 and TMD8 cells) indicated resistance to the cyclin dependent inhibitor dinaciclib, with an increased IC50 (p=0.0068); increased expression of MCL1 did not exhibit the same effects. However this resistance was overcome by the synergistic effects demonstrated through the SCID mouse model with a combination of both dinaciclib and a BCL1 inhibitor ABT-199. Combination of ABT199/dinaciclib (n=80) displayed a substantial improved survival rate (p<0.0001) in comparison to the tumor-bearing mice with an IP vehicle present with either ABT-199 or dinaciclib. These results indicate the potential synergistic effects of targeting both BCL2 and MCL2 expression.",

Sorafenib-resistant clones were collected for mutational analysis, of which a Y842C mutation was identified in the tyrosine kinase domain 2 (TKD2). Ba/F3-ITD cells were engineered with Y842C (Ba/F3-ITD+842) and evaluated for in vitro activity of sorefanib. Compared to control cells with only FLT3-ITD (EC50: 0.006 umol/L), cells with double mutation FLT3-ITD and Y842C demonstrated greater resistance to sorafenib-induced apoptosis (EC50: 2.6 umol/L). Although mutation in either TKD was sufficient to provide resistance to sorafenib-induced apoptosis, mutation in TKD2 (Y842C) was more important to the acquired resistance compared to alteration in TKD1 (D651G, N676D, I687F). Furthermore, FLT3-ITD cells containing compound mutations in both TKDs (D676D and Y842C in Ba/F3-ITD+676/842 cells) displayed greatest resistance to sorafenib-induced apoptosis (EC50: 6.6 umol/L). Cells harboring TKD2 mutations (Ba/F3-ITD+842 and Ba/F3+676/842) were least sensitive to the inhibitory effects of sorafenib, and maintained persistent phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream effectors ERK, AKT, Stat5, and S6K after exposure to sorafenib. Increased level of phosphorylated ERK was observed in ITD and Y842C cells (Ba/F3-ITD+842), and persistent phosphorylated-AKT, -Stat5, and -S6K in ITD and compound N676D/Y842C cells (Ba/F3-ITD+676/842). These results suggested FLT3 gene point mutations in TKD2 may result in conformational change that interfere with binding ability (i.e., accessibilty) of sorafenib more than mutations occurring in TKD1, and eluded to a bypass/feedback regulation could be an effective approach in the modulation of FLT3 downstream signaling.",
