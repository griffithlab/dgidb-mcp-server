\
In vitro studies, cells with oncomorphic p53 demonstrate increased invasion, migration, angiogenesis, survival, and proliferation as well as resistance to chemotherapy. A knock in mouse model of the TP53 R248Q mutant was created, and these mice display accelerated tumor onset as well as a shortened survival",
