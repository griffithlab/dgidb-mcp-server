      "description": "In this open-label phase II study, 20 patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) were recruited between 2003-2005. 13/20 patients were KIT D816V mutation-positive. Among those patients, two reported improvements in some symptoms, but no one achieved any objective clinical response. Based on those observations, authors suggest that imatinib therapy does not result in appreciable clinical activity in patients with D816V positive mutation",
