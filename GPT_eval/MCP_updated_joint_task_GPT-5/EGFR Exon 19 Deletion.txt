Immune checkpoint inhibitor included PD-1 inhibitor alone, PD-L1 inhibitor alone or PD-(L)1 inhibitor / CTLA-4 inhibitor combination. These patients were compared to 212 previously published EGFR wild type patient outcomes. The response rate in patients with EGFR wild type, EGFR L858R mutation, and EGFR exon 19 deletions were 22, 16, and 7% respectively.",
