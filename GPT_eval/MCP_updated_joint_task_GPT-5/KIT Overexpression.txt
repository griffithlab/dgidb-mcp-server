      "description": "Imatinib-resistant GIST882IR cells were derived by treating mice inoculated with GIST882 with imatinib over 6 passages. Western blots showed increased KIT protein expression in GIST882IR cells compared to GIST882 cells. Derived imatinib-resistant cell line GIST822IR demonstrated overexpression in p55PIK in comparison to the parental cell line GIST822. To evaluate p55PIK expression relevancy GIST882 cell lines were infected with lentivirus construct expressing the p55PIK (Lenti-p55PIK) and control lentivirus (Lenti-con). Overexpressing p55PIK GIST882 cells showed greater imatinib resistance than that of the (Lenti-con) infected GIST882 cells. It was found the p55PIK increases KIT expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Down-regulation of p55PIK or blocking NF-κB signaling led to decreased KIT and re-sensitized GIST882IR cells to imatinib.",
