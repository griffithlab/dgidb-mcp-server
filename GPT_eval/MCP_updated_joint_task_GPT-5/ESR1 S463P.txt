Consecutively resistance to these agents has emerged.  After prolonged exposure to the selective and potent CDK4/6 inhibitor Acemaciclib (LY2835219) clones emerged and several were found to harbor amplification of the CDK6 kinase. Amplification of CDK6 resulted in a marked increase in CDK6 expression and reduced response of the CDK4/6 target, phospho-Rb (pRb), to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Knockdown of CDK6 restored drug sensitivity, while enforced overexpression of CDK6 was sufficient to mediate drug resistance. Furthermore, CDK6 amplification lead to reduced expression of the ER and progesterone receptor (PR), and diminished responsiveness to ER antagonism. The reduced ER/PR expression after CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance was additionally observed in tumor biopsy specimens from patients treated with these drugs. Alternative mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as loss of pRb and cyclin E1 overexpression also exhibited decreased hormone responsiveness.",
