Patients were randomized to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant (P+F) or placebo plus fulvestrant (F). A paired ctDNA exome sequencing was conducted to analyze clonal composition. RB1 mutations were identified in 6/127 patients (p=0.041), part of the P + F arm, while no RB1 mutations were identified in the patients treated with fulvestrant alone, at EOT (end of treatment). ESR1 mutations were noted in 25.1% at day 1, and 31.3% of the patients at EOT. An increased proportion of PIK3CA mutations were noted at EOT compared to day 1  (19% v/s 26.7%; p = 0.00069). Additionally, the proportions of patients with new PIK3CA mutations did not differ between the two treatment groups, which suggests that these mutations may play a role in fulvestrant resistance. Strong evidence was reported for positive selection for ESR1 Y537S through the treatment in both treatment groups (p=0.0037), suggesting this mutation may promote resistance to fulvestrant. The data also indicates that resistance to fulvestrant may be a major genetic driver of resistance to the combination treatment.",

      "description": "Breast cancer cell lines derived from T-47D (vector control, overexpress cyclin E1, overexpress cyclin E2) were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 and CDK2 inhibitor SNS-032 as single agents and in combination. Single agent treatment with PD0332991 in cyclin E1- or cyclin E2–overexpressing cells showed to be ineffective at reducing the relative cell number and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay in comparison to the vector control cells; thus indicating resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor PD033299. However, combination of PD0332991 and SNS-032 reduced BrdURd incorporation and relative cell number compared to single agents. This effect of combinational therapies suggests CDK4 inhibitor resistance due to overexpression of cyclin E1 or E2, can be overcome by combining CDK2 inhibitors such as SNS-032.",

In resistant xenografts, western blot analysis showed a decrease of pRb protein levels in 4 of 7 CDK4/6-acquired resistant tumors and a sustained expression of the E2F target cyclin E2, in contrast to CDK4/6 inhibitor-sensitive PDX244. Genomic characterization of PDX244LR1 showed the acquisition of an RB1 frameshift mutation (RB1 p.M695fs*26).",
